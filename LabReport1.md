## Commands:
### cd  
No arguments:
```
cd
```
The cd command changes the working directory. I used the cd command in the /lecture1/messages directory. Using the command without passing any arguments resulted in no output from the terminal. However, it brought me back to the /home directory. Upon further experimentation, using cd with no arguments changes the working directory to /home no matter what the current working directory is. Given that this output does not produce an error message or problematic behavior, it is not an error.
